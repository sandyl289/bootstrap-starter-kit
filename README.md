# Bootstrap Starter Pack
This is a super simple starter kit which uses Bootstrap to create a website. 
You can clone it and it will give you a basic Bootstrap project that you can then use it for a hackathon! 
Feel free to edit it as you need!

## How do I use this?
You should clone this repo (or download it as a .zip file) to your computer.
If you download it as a .zip, you'll need to uncompress (open) it. Yo ucan then open the folder iun any code editor, including VS Code and Atom.

There are lots of example files in the repo. Feel free to change or remove them!
